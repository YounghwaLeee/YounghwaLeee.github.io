          covid-19가 전국민의 일상에 많은 영향을 끼치고, 백신수급으로 인해 힘들어 할 시기에 백신 종류를 선택하여 맞을 수 있는 날을 희망하며 프로젝트로 구현하게 되었습니다. 코로나 관련 백신예약 / 진료소 검색 등의 기능을 구현하였습니다.

          Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
